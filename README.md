# Animal Monitoring and Surveillance
# Project Overview
This project was developed for a government proposal and focuses on enhancing wildlife management and ensuring human safety through advanced monitoring solutions. It aims to proactively address human-animal conflicts in the Sathyamangalam Forest area near Erode.

# Features

Night Vision Surveillance
Integrated CCTV cameras with night vision capabilities to monitor forest areas bordering villages, providing continuous surveillance in low-light conditions.

Animal Detection and Alerts
Utilized advanced computer vision algorithms to detect animals entering villages, activating an alarm system to alert residents of potential threats.

Proactive Wildlife Management
Implemented sound systems designed to drive animals back into the forest, offering a proactive approach to wildlife management and improving safety for local communities.

Dataset
Collecting an Real time dataset from an various open source platform like YOUTUBE, KAGGLE and Open Field Camera to pre-process and train the customized Model

# Technologies Used

Python: For developing computer vision algorithms and system integration.
CCTV Technology: For night vision surveillance capabilities.
Sound System Integration: To deter animals from approaching populated areas.

# Under Guidance
Dr. Rajasekharen T (Head of CSE Dept), Nandha Engineering College, Erode.

# Future Enhancements
Exploring the integration of machine learning for improved animal detection accuracy and real-time data analytics for better decision-making.
